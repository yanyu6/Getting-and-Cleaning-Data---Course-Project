# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data---Course-Project
===============================================================
In this course project, we need to show our abilities to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

The link of the original data is here:

We first need to prepare a tidy data set by runing our own run_analysis script.
There are five requirements we need to meet step by step.
1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

After we created our R script and obtained a tidy data set, we need to 
 1) upload the txt file of our tidy data set, 
 2) creat a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis,
 and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 
We also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
